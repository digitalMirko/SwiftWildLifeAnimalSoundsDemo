In this demo app we demonstrate how to code a Swift Wild Life Animal Sound Demo App.

There are so many interesting things within Swift. This demo shows one way to code a Swift Wild Life Animal Sound Demo
that could be used to demonstate how a wild animal sounds. Its a great demo that can be used to teach children how
animals in the wild sound by clicking a cartoon wildlife animal and hearing them speak. At the bottom of the app is a 
slider which is used to control the volume sound on the app. The default is set to the highest level 1.0.

The animal sounds used in this demo were found on a google search for animal sounds off the google sound page.<br>
The clip art animals used were found on clipart-library.com<br>
The african jungle background was found on 123rt.com.<br>
